Sickbed Sympathies

In years to come, Katie Bell and Susan Bones appreciated the accidents that put them in St Mungo's. Susan would joke that the twinge in her leg reminds her how she met Katie.  Recalling the sound of Susan's voice reading to her while she lay there paralyzed, Katie agrees that accidents have their upside.  But why couldn't they have met when Katie was playing Quidditch?  Katie never got the chance to have a fan. And Susan still has nightmares of losing her leg.  Small problems though when they think of their old schoolmates from Hogwarts who never made it.

Meeting up with Hermione for the Hogwarts' Girls' Reunion brought those times back again.
